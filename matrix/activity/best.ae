 Computers can't yet do any of these things very well – it's still much easier to explain to someone how
 to tie their shoelaces than it is to set the clock on the video machine.
 The most important thing you need to keep in mind, though, is that you're never going to be able to
 express a task to a computer if you can't express it to yourself. Computer programming leaves little
 room for vague specifications and hand waving. If you want to write a program to, say, remove useless
 files from your computer, you need to be able to explain how to determine whether a file is useless or
 not. You need to examine and break down your own mental processes when carrying out the task for
 yourself: Should you delete a file that hasn't been accessed for a long time? How long, precisely? Do
 you delete it immediately, or do you examine it? If you examine it, how much of it? And what are you
 examining it for?
 The first step in programming is to stop thinking in terms of 'I want a program that removes useless
 files,' but instead thinking 'I want a program that looks at each file on the computer in turn and deletes
 the file if it is over six months old and if the first five lines do not contain any of the words 'Simon',
 'Perl' or 'important'. In other words, you have to specify your task precisely.
 When you're able to restructure your question, you need to translate that into the programming
 language you're using. Unfortunately, the programming language may not have a direct equivalent for
 what you're trying to say. So, you have to get your meaning across using what parts of the language are
 available to you, and this may well mean breaking down your task yet further. For instance, there's no
 way of saying 'if the first five lines do not contain any of the following words' in Perl. However, there is
 a way of saying 'if a line contains this word', a way of saying 'get another line', and 'do this five times'.
 Programming is the art of putting those elements together to get them to do what you want.
 So much for what you have to do – what does the computer have to do? Once we have specified the
 task in our programming language, the computer takes our instructions and performs them. We call this
 running or executing the program. Usually, we'll specify the instructions in a file, which we edit with an
 ordinary text editor; sometimes, if we have a small program, we can get away with typing the whole
 thing in at the command line. Either way, the instructions that we give to the computer – in our case,
 written in Perl – are collectively called the source code (or sometimes just code) to our program.
