 from the mast by the distance the ship had moved during the fall. 13 Galileo maintained there would
 be no displacement because, first, the rock shares in the motion of the ship, 14 and second, free
 particles move without movers, that free particlesâ€”those with no forces acting on themâ€”once set
 in motion, maintain that state of motion, termed inertial motion. 15 The rock accelerates under the
 action of gravity, but maintains its constant motion in the direction of the uniform motion of the ship
 because there is no force acting in that direction (assuming negligible wind resistance). 16
