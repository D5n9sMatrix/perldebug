 6 The principle of relativity is a different kind of law than other physical principles. It presumes
 the existence of laws of nature, that there are reproducible manifestations of the workings of nature
 waiting for us to describe, of which we possess a language rich enough to accurately describe. That
 language is mathematics, which physics relies on heavily. It’s remarkable that mathematics, a human
 invention, applies so well to the description of nature. To quote Eugene Wigner:[1] “. . . the
 mathematical formulation of the physicist’s often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of cases
 to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of phenomena. This shows that the mathematical
 language has more to commend it than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is,
 in a very real sense, the correct language.” 7 If you’re uneasy about tensors, don’t worry; students
 are frequently ill-prepared when it comes to tensors. The mathe- magics of tensors will be developed
 as we proceed. Vectors are special cases of tensors. 8 Galileo did not explicitly isolate the concept
 of inertial motion as a general principle, yet it’s quite clear from his writings that he understood it.
 Even today, students of physics are well advised to read Galileo’s Dialogue.[3] 9 There are reference
 frames in which the law of inertia does not hold, inertial reference frames—see Section 1.6.
 10 We’ll refer to inertial observers as observers at rest relative to IRFs. The “observer” is essentially
 the reference frame. 11 Aristotle classified motion as natural and unnatural. Natural motion occurs among
 the four elements air, earth, fire, and water, which seek to find their natural places, e.g., heavy objects
 naturally move toward the center of the earth. Natural motion is unforced, not requiring the action of an
 external agency. Unnatural motion, however, such as horizontal motion on Earth, is forced and requires a
 mover. What’s the “mover” when the rock leaves your hand? Aristotle argued that air, displaced by the motion
 of the rock, wraps around the rock and pushes it on. A rock thrown in vacuum would not move! 12 The history
 of inertia is more involved than our account here. A succession of investigators in the time between
 Aristotle and Galileo questioned the Aristotelian theory.
